Since I'm using the free version of Moralis, a limited number of calls can be made.

## Technologies Used


- **Moralis Web3 API**: Moralis provides a powerful Web3 API that simplifies interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, making it easier to retrieve and manage blockchain data.

- **Next.js**: Next.js, built on top of Node.js, is a popular React framework that facilitates the creation of fast and server-rendered applications.

## Features


1. Retrieving the current Ether price.
2. Displaying the latest blocks on the Ethereum blockchain.
3. Listing the most recent transactions that have occurred.
4. Providing a detailed view of all transactions associated with a specific wallet address.


<========================================================================================>


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
